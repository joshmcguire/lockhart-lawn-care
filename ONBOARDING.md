## What it is

Marketing site for a Lockhart TX lawn care business — commercial-client-focused static front-end, near-zero hosting cost

Two or three sentences of context: why it exists, who it is for, current phase.

## Tech stack

- <framework / language / hosting>

## Architecture (the load-bearing ideas)

- <idea> (ADR NNNN)
- <idea> (ADR NNNN)

## When to read deeper (trigger → file)

This file plus CLAUDE.md is the working altitude. Pull a deep file only when its trigger
matches the task; do not read them all "to be safe".

- Any architectural choice → `docs/PRINCIPLES.md`, then grep `decisions/` for relevant ADRs
- Touching <subsystem, e.g. auth> → `decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md`
- Touching <subsystem, e.g. data model> → `decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md`
- <task type, e.g. deploying> → `docs/<deep doc>.md`

## How to run
